+ Once there, look for the `HuffmanEncodedResul` mehtod that has already been implemented for you
+ Make sure the ` load_data ` methodhas as parameter a valid input ` .txt ` file that is stored in the ` inputData ` directory
+ Compile and Run the ```HuffmanCoding.java``` file and the code should run if implemented correctly
